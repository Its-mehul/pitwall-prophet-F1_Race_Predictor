## 1. Introduction

### Project Goal
This project develops a sophisticated machine learning system to predict complete Formula 1 (F1) race finishing orders, including the critical handling of Did Not Finish (DNF) scenarios. The system predicts positions 1-20 for all drivers in a race, accounting for the fact that DNFs compress the finishing positions of remaining drivers - a key insight that differentiates this work from standard multi-class classification.

### Input Features
The model uses comprehensive race telemetry and historical performance data:
- **Grid Position Features**: Starting grid position and normalized grid position (0.05-1.0)
- **Pit Strategy Features**: Number of pit stops, pit lap fractions, pit timing, pit strategy indicators
- **Performance Features**: Fastest lap rankings, lap fractions, time deltas from pole position
- **Historical Features**: Driver DNF rates, team DNF rates, circuit DNF rates
- **Team One-Hot Encoding**: Binary features for all F1 teams (Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, etc.)

### Importance and Innovation
F1 race prediction presents unique challenges: extreme class imbalance (only ~14% DNFs), position interdependence, and the need for realistic race outcome simulation. Traditional approaches fail to capture how DNFs compress finishing positions. This project implements a conditional neural architecture that learns the relationship between DNF probability and position distribution, using advanced algorithms for optimal position assignment and realistic outcome compression.

## 2. Data Collection

### Web Scraping Infrastructure
We developed a comprehensive web scraping pipeline using BeautifulSoup and Requests to collect data from formula1.com:

```python
def scrape_race_results(year, round_num):
    """Scrape complete race results including DNF information"""
    url = f"https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/{year}/races/{round_num}/race-result.html"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract finishing positions, DNF status, timing data
    # Parse driver and team information
    # Handle special cases (DNS, DSQ, etc.)
```

### Data Sources and Processing
- **Coverage**: 2021-2025 F1 seasons (complete race data)
- **Granularity**: One row per driver per race (20 drivers × ~22 races/year)
- **Total Dataset**: ~2,200 driver-race instances
- **Features Extracted**: 45+ engineered features per driver

### Annotation Process
- **Algorithmic Annotation**: Automated DNF classification from race results
- **Feature Engineering**: Normalized timing data, pit strategy analysis, historical performance aggregation
- **Quality Control**: Automated validation and missing data imputation

### Train/Validation/Test Split
Temporal split respecting race chronology:
- **Training**: Rounds 1-10 (2021-2024 seasons)
- **Validation**: Rounds 11-13 (cross-validation)
- **Test**: Rounds 14-15 (2025 season, held-out)

## 3. Methods

### Baseline Model (ChatGPT-Suggested)
Following the project requirement, we first implemented ChatGPT's suggested baseline for F1 winner prediction:

**ChatGPT Prompt:**
"I am doing a machine learning class project where I predict whether a Formula 1 driver will win a race based on mid-race style features... Please propose a baseline that includes: data splitting, feature selection, a simple feed-forward neural network, loss function, and evaluation metrics."

**Key ChatGPT Recommendations:**
- Temporal train/validation/test split by race rounds
- Simple MLP with BatchNorm, ReLU, Dropout (0.2)
- BCEWithLogitsLoss with positive class weighting
- Adam optimizer (lr=1e-3), early stopping
- Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC evaluation

### Advanced Methodology: Beyond the Baseline

#### 3.1 Conditional Neural Architecture
We developed a dual-head neural network that predicts DNFs and positions simultaneously:

```python
class PositionPredictionNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_layers=(128, 64), dropout=0.2):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Shared encoder
        layers = [nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_layers[0]), nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_layers[0]), nn.ReLU(), nn.Dropout(dropout)]
        for i in range(len(hidden_layers)-1):
            layers.extend([nn.Linear(hidden_layers[i], hidden_layers[i+1]), nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_layers[i+1]), nn.ReLU(), nn.Dropout(dropout)])
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(*layers)
        
        # Conditional heads
        self.dnf_head = nn.Linear(hidden_layers[-1], 1)  # Binary DNF prediction
        self.position_head = nn.Linear(hidden_layers[-1] + 1, 21)  # 21 classes (1-20 + DNF)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.encoder(x)
        dnf_logits = self.dnf_head(features)
        dnf_probs = torch.sigmoid(dnf_logits)
        
        # Position prediction conditioned on DNF probability
        position_input = torch.cat([features, dnf_probs], dim=1)
        position_logits = self.position_head(position_input)
        
        return position_logits, dnf_probs
```

#### 3.2 Advanced Loss Function: Focal Loss
To handle extreme class imbalance (only 14% DNFs), we implemented Focal Loss with class weighting:

```python
class FocalLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, alpha=None, gamma=2.0, reduction='none'):
        super().__init__()
        self.alpha = alpha  # Class weights
        self.gamma = gamma  # Focusing parameter
        
    def forward(self, inputs, targets):
        ce_loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(inputs, targets, weight=self.alpha, reduction='none')
        pt = torch.exp(-ce_loss)
        focal_loss = ((1 - pt) ** self.gamma) * ce_loss
        return focal_loss

# Implementation with 10x DNF weight boost
class_weights[20] *= 10.0  # DNF class gets 10x weight
criterion = FocalLoss(alpha=class_weights, gamma=2.0)
```

#### 3.3 Hungarian Algorithm for Optimal Position Assignment
The core innovation: using combinatorial optimization to assign positions optimally:

```python
def hungarian_matching(self, pred_probs, mask=None):
    """Solve assignment problem using Hungarian algorithm"""
    batch_size, num_drivers, num_positions = pred_probs.shape
    assignments = np.zeros((batch_size, num_drivers), dtype=np.int32)
    
    for b in range(batch_size):
        cost_matrix = -pred_probs[b].cpu().detach().numpy()
        if mask is not None:
            valid_drivers = mask[b].cpu().numpy().astype(bool)
            cost_matrix[~valid_drivers] = 1e9
        
        row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)
        assignments[b, row_ind] = col_ind + 1
    
    return assignments
```

#### 3.4 DNF Position Compression Algorithm
Realistic race outcome simulation by compressing positions when DNFs occur:

```python
def adjust_positions_for_dnfs(self, assignments):
    """Compress finishing positions when DNFs occur"""
    batch_size, num_drivers = assignments.shape
    adjusted_assignments = np.zeros_like(assignments)
    
    for b in range(batch_size):
        race_assignments = assignments[b]
        dnf_mask = race_assignments == 21
        non_dnf_mask = ~dnf_mask
        
        # Sort non-DNF drivers by predicted positions
        non_dnf_indices = np.where(non_dnf_mask)[0]
        non_dnf_positions = race_assignments[non_dnf_indices]
        sorted_order = np.argsort(non_dnf_positions)
        
        # Compress: DNFs stay 21, finishers get 1,2,3,...
        adjusted_race = np.full(num_drivers, 21, dtype=np.int32)
        for new_pos, idx in enumerate(sorted_order):
            driver_idx = non_dnf_indices[idx]
            adjusted_race[driver_idx] = new_pos + 1
        
        adjusted_assignments[b] = adjusted_race
    
    return adjusted_assignments
```

#### 3.5 Training and Regularization

- **Learning Rate**: 1e-3 with early stopping
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified by race
- **Regularization**: Dropout (0.2), BatchNorm, early stopping

#### 3.6 Evaluation Framework
Comprehensive metrics capturing different prediction aspects:

```python
def compute_position_accuracy(self, preds, targets, masks, tolerance=0):
    """Compute position prediction accuracy with tolerance"""
    valid = (targets <= 20) & (masks == 1)
    if tolerance == 0:
        correct = (np.abs(preds - targets) <= tolerance) & valid
    else:
        correct = (np.abs(preds - targets) <= tolerance) & valid
    return correct.sum() / valid.sum() if valid.sum() > 0 else 0.0
```
